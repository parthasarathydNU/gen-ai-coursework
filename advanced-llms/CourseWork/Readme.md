# Friendly Guide to Large Language Models, RAG, and AI Agents

Welcome to our collection of learning materials about some of the most exciting topics in AI today: Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and AI Agents!

## What's Inside?

This folder is packed with resources to help you understand:

1. **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: The powerful AI systems behind chatbots and text generators.
2. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: A clever way to make AI use external information.
3. **AI Agents**: AI systems that can perform tasks and make decisions.
