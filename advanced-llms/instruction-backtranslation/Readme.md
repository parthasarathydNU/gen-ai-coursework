# Implementation of Instruction Backtranslation for Enhanced LLM Training

## Abstract
This project, implements the groundbreaking instruction backtranslation technique, inspired by the seminal work of Xian Li et al. from Meta, as detailed in their paper [Self-Alignment with Instruction Backtranslation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.06259). Our implementation demonstrates the entire pipeline from training a seed model to self-augmentation and self-curation, culminating in the fine-tuning of a more powerful model. This scalable method showcases how large language models (LLMs) can autonomously improve their instruction-following capabilities.

## Introduction
Instruction backtranslation is revolutionizing the way LLMs are aligned to follow instructions. By leveraging vast amounts of unlabelled data and minimal human-annotated seed data, this technique generates high-quality instructional data through an iterative self-training process. The result is a highly efficient model that excels in instruction-following tasks, setting new benchmarks in generative AI performance. This project replicates the technique and explores its vast potential across multiple domains.

### Data Preparation
The implementation uses a robust web corpus and a small set of seed data. Our preprocessing pipeline ensures the dataset is in prime condition for effective training.

### Model Architecture
Utilizing state-of-the-art transformer-based architectures, the project involves training a backward model to generate instructions and a base model fine-tuned with curated, high-quality data.

### Implementation Steps
1. **Training the Backward Model**: Fine-tuning the seed model to generate accurate instructions from the web corpus.
2. **Creating Instructions**: Leveraging the backward model to generate instruction prompts tailored to web documents.
3. **Self-Curation Process**: Implementing a sophisticated self-curation mechanism to filter and select the highest quality instruction-output pairs.
4. **Fine-Tuning the Base Model**: Using the curated data to fine-tune the base model, significantly enhancing its instruction-following performance.
