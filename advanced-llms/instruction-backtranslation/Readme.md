# Implementation of Instruction Backtranslation for Enhanced LLM Training

## Abstract
This project, developed by Dhruv Parthasarathy and Akshay, implements the groundbreaking instruction backtranslation technique, inspired by the seminal work of Xian Li et al. from Meta, as detailed in their paper [Self-Alignment with Instruction Backtranslation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.06259). Our implementation demonstrates the entire pipeline from training a seed model to self-augmentation and self-curation, culminating in the fine-tuning of a more powerful model. This scalable method showcases how large language models (LLMs) can autonomously improve their instruction-following capabilities.

## Introduction
Instruction backtranslation is revolutionizing the way LLMs are aligned to follow instructions. By leveraging vast amounts of unlabelled data and minimal human-annotated seed data, this technique generates high-quality instructional data through an iterative self-training process. The result is a highly efficient model that excels in instruction-following tasks, setting new benchmarks in generative AI performance. This project replicates the technique and explores its vast potential across multiple domains.

## Methodology
### Data Preparation
The implementation uses a robust web corpus and a small set of seed data. Our preprocessing pipeline ensures the dataset is in prime condition for effective training.

### Model Architecture
Utilizing state-of-the-art transformer-based architectures, the project involves training a backward model to generate instructions and a base model fine-tuned with curated, high-quality data.

### Implementation Steps
1. **Training the Backward Model**: Fine-tuning the seed model to generate accurate instructions from the web corpus.
2. **Creating Instructions**: Leveraging the backward model to generate instruction prompts tailored to web documents.
3. **Self-Curation Process**: Implementing a sophisticated self-curation mechanism to filter and select the highest quality instruction-output pairs.
4. **Fine-Tuning the Base Model**: Using the curated data to fine-tune the base model, significantly enhancing its instruction-following performance.
