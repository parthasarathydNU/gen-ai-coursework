# CNN Introduction Project

## Overview
This project serves as an introductory guide to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are a class of deep neural networks widely used in analyzing visual imagery. The aim is to provide hands-on experience in building, training, and evaluating CNN models using TensorFlow/Keras. This project focuses on basic image recognition tasks that illustrate how CNNs can extract patterns and features from images.

## Features
- **Basic CNN Architecture**: Learn the fundamentals of building a CNN including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
- **Image Classification**: Implement a CNN to classify images from a provided dataset.
- **Model Evaluation**: Techniques to evaluate the performance of the trained model on test data.
- **Visualization**: Methods to visualize the filters and feature maps in the CNN to understand what features your model is learning.

## Contributions
We welcome contributions from students and faculty. If you wish to contribute to the project, please fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
