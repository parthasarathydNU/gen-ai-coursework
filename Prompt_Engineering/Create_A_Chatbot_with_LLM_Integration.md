The goal of this assignment is to develop a simple chatbot that leverages the strengths of Large Language Models (LLM) for understanding and processing natural language queries. You have the flexibility to choose a use case in any domain of your interest - Pharma, Music, Health, History, Art, Sciences, Tech, Sports, Food, Martial Arts, Languages, Philosophy etc..

Implementing RAG is NOT REQUIRED for this assignment.

Objective:

To understand the process of integrating LLMs with user interfaces

Tasks: 

1. Domain Selection: Choose a specific domain for your application. Define the user base and how does you application help them. Clearly define the scope and type of queries your application will handle.

2. Application Development:
- Develop your application with a user interface that allows users to input natural language queries or preferences, you can look at implementing prompting patterns here like Persona, Flipped Interaction, Cognitive Verifier, Template, Chain of thought, etc...
Implement any LLM of choice (local or hosted) for query processing ensuring the system returns relevant responses.

3. Evaluation and Testing:
- Test your application thoroughly through a varied range of queries or inputs to evaluate its performance, accuracy and to demonstrate the usability of the application.

You can use the following:
- LLMs: Use OpenAI models or any other similar or open-source models - local or hosted for generating responses.
- Frontend: Streamlit / React / Any UI of choice

Additional guidelines:

Submit your assignment by pushing the source code, documentation, and any additional resources to a GitHub repository and submit the GitHub repository link
Include a README.md in the repository with detailed instructions to set up and run the application, along with a YouTube video link demonstrating your application's unique features

Grading Criteria: 

An app that has a user interface and talks to an LLM - 80%

Remaining 20% is based on:
- The usefulness of responses that your app returns for your selected user base
- The variety of queries that your application handles
- Professional video walk through submitted in the GitHub Readme along with complete documentation
