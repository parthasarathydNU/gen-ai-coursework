# RAG Pipeline Performance Metrics and Improvement Assignment

## Objective

The goal of this assignment is to focus on calculating and reporting the performance metrics of your RAG pipeline. Additionally, explore methods to improve these metrics. This assignment aims to strengthen your understanding of evaluation techniques and optimization methods for RAG systems.

## Assignment Description

You are required to evaluate your previously developed RAG-based chatbot and report on its performance metrics. The focus will be on understanding and improving key metrics that influence the effectiveness of your RAG pipeline.

## Key Requirements

### Performance Metrics Calculation

Calculate the following metrics for your RAG pipeline:

#### Retrieval Metrics
- Context Precision: Measure how accurately the retrieved context matches the user's query.
- Context Recall: Evaluate the ability to retrieve all relevant contexts for the user's query.
- Context Relevance: Assess the relevance of the retrieved context to the user's query.
- Context Entity Recall: Determine the ability to recall relevant entities within the context.
- Noise Robustness: Test the system's ability to handle noisy or irrelevant inputs.

#### Generation Metrics
- Faithfulness: Measure the accuracy and reliability of the generated answers.
- Answer Relevance: Evaluate the relevance of the generated answers to the user's query.
- Information Integration: Assess the ability to integrate and present information cohesively.
- Counterfactual Robustness: Test the robustness of the system against counterfactual or contradictory queries.
- Negative Rejection: Measure the system's ability to reject and handle negative or inappropriate queries.
- Latency: Measure the response time of the system from receiving a query to delivering an answer.

### Methods to Improve Metrics
- Propose and implement methods to improve at least two of the above metrics.
- Document the changes made and analyze their impact on the overall performance of the RAG pipeline.

### Report
Provide a detailed report that includes:
- The methodology used to calculate each metric.
- The results obtained for each metric.
- The methods proposed and implemented for improvement.
- A comparative analysis of the performance before and after the improvements.
- Challenges faced and how they were addressed.

### Code and Documentation
- Submit the source code used to calculate the metrics and implement the improvements.
- Include clear documentation explaining how to run the code and reproduce the results.

### Video Demonstration
- Record a short video demonstration showing the evaluation process and the improvements made to the RAG pipeline.
- The video should highlight key aspects of your implementation and findings.

## Submission Requirements
- Functional Evaluation Code: Code for calculating metrics and implementing improvements.
- Report: A detailed PDF report as described above.
- Video Demonstration: Link to a YouTube video demonstrating the evaluation process and improvements.
- GitHub Repository: A publicly accessible GitHub repository containing the code, documentation, and report.

## Grading Criteria

### Research and Exploration (40 points)
- Depth of Research (20 points): Thoroughness and relevance of research conducted to understand and calculate the metrics.
- Exploration of Methods (20 points): Creativity and effectiveness in exploring methods to improve the metrics.

### Documentation and Explanation (30 points)
- Clarity of Report (15 points): The report should be well-structured, clear, and concise.
- Quality of Explanations (15 points): Explanations should be thorough, demonstrating a deep understanding of the methods and findings.

### Methodology and Findings (20 points)
- Appropriateness of Methodology (10 points): The chosen methodology should be suitable for calculating the metrics.
- Analysis of Findings (10 points): The analysis should be insightful and present areas of improvement based on the results.

### Presentation and Communication (10 points)
- Quality of Video Demonstration (5 points): The video should clearly demonstrate the evaluation process and highlight key findings.
- Overall Presentation (5 points): The overall presentation of the report, code, and documentation should be professional and coherent.
