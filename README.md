# Gen AI Coursework

## Overview
This repository contains assignments and projects related to the various Generative AI courses that I am exploring. The projects cover a wide range of topics, including deep learning, neural networks, machine learning algorithms, and practical applications of AI technologies.

*Given my background in Software Engineering, I make a concerted effort to delve deeply into each concept to grasp the underlying fundamentals thoroughly. In each notebook, you will find detailed explanations and examples designed to enhance understanding and provide clarity on how things work under the hood.*

## Suggested Order for Beginners
For those new to Generative AI, I recommend following this sequential path through the projects in this repository to build a foundational understanding before advancing to more complex topics:

1. **cnn-intro**: Start with the basics of neural networks by exploring Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This project will help you understand fundamental neural network architectures and their applications.
2. **loan-data-classification**: Apply what you've learned about neural networks to a practical problemâ€”classifying loan data using Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). This will give you hands-on experience with supervised learning.
3. **clustering-colors**: Diversify your skills with an unsupervised learning project. Use the k-means clustering technique to segment images based on color similarity, deepening your understanding of how algorithms can group data without labels.
4. **sentence-similarity**: Move on to natural language processing by exploring different methods for calculating sentence similarity. This project transitions from traditional to neural network-based techniques, including word embeddings and RAG.
5. **advanced-llms**: With a solid base in neural networks and NLP, delve into advanced language models, from simple MLPs to Transformer Models. This section includes various projects and experiments that expand on the architecture and functionality of sophisticated language models.
6. **vae-intro**: Learn about Variational Autoencoders, particularly convolutional models, to understand generative models in AI. This project is crucial for grasping how machines can generate new data instances that resemble training data.
7. **gan**: Explore Generative Adversarial Networks through the provided Jupyter notebook. This addition will deepen your understanding of another vital generative model, showcasing the dynamic between generator and discriminator networks in creating new data samples.
