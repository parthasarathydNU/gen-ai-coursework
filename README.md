# Gen AI Coursework at Northeastern University

## Overview
This repository contains assignments and projects related to the various Generative AI courses offered at Northeastern University. The projects cover a wide range of topics, including deep learning, neural networks, machine learning algorithms, and practical applications of AI technologies.

## Projects
Each folder in the repository corresponds to a specific project or assignment. Below is a brief description of what each contains:

- **advanced-llms**: Projects and experiments involving advanced language model implementations right from building a simple MLP to discussing the architecture of Transformer Models
- **clustering-colors**: Segment images based on the similarity of colors using the RGB color space. Exploring the k-means clustering techinique on images
- **cnn-intro**: Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), including basic implementations and experiments to understand effect on the performance by varying modeling aspects
- **loan-data-classification**: Machine Learning project involving the classification of loan data using Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs)
- **sentence-similarity**: The project covers traditional methods for calculating sentence similarity, providing a foundation before diving into more advanced, neural network-based techniques including word embeddings and RAG
